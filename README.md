In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. You’ll model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.
